# productive-bees
A python script to create productive bees. This is work in progress bugs could happen. Have fun!

## How to use:

This script generates three files:

The first file, named after your bee, should be placed in "kubejs/data/productivebees/productivebees".
The next two files should be placed in their corresponding folders within "kubejs/data/productivebees/recipes":
    The file with "_bee" should be in either the "bee_breeding" or the "bee_conversion" folder.
    The file with "_produce" should be placed in the "bee_produce" folder.

If you encounter issues while getting a bee to work, please check the official Productive Bees GitHub repository to see if the same bee is available. If it exists, ensure that you follow the same path as in the Git repository to edit the bee:

Official Productive Bees Git

Additionally, if you want to edit existing bees, check the official Git repository, download their files, and place them in the same path as them. (By "same path," I mean you need to check after the "data" folder.)
